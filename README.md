# use-majboori ü§∑

> A React hook that forces you to justify your `useEffect` usage

**Majboori** (ŸÖÿ¨ÿ®Ÿàÿ±€å) means "helplessness" or "compulsion" in Urdu/Hindi. This package is for when you have *no choice* but to use `useEffect` - but you better have a good reason! üò§

## Why?

`useEffect` is overused. Developers reach for it when they shouldn't. This hook makes you think twice by requiring you to provide a justification for every effect.

Perfect for teams that want to discourage casual `useEffect` usage and promote better React patterns.

## Installation

```bash
npm install use-majboori
# or
yarn add use-majboori
# or
pnpm add use-majboori
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useMajboori } from 'use-majboori';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // ‚ùå This won't let you forget why you're using an effect
  useMajboori(
    () => {
      document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
    },
    [count],
    "Need to update document title because browser API can only be accessed in effects"
  );

  return <div>{count}</div>;
}
```

## API

```typescript
useMajboori(
  effect: EffectCallback,
  deps: DependencyList | undefined,
  reason: string
): void
```

### Parameters

- **effect**: The effect function to run (same as `useEffect`)
- **deps**: The dependency array (same as `useEffect`)
- **reason**: **REQUIRED** - A string explaining why you need to use this effect

### Development Mode Warnings

In development mode, `useMajboori` will:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warn you if the reason is empty or too short (< 10 characters)
- üìù Log the reason to the console so your team can see your justifications

In production mode, it silently passes through to `useEffect` with no overhead.

## Pair with ESLint

For maximum effectiveness, add an ESLint rule to ban direct `useEffect` usage:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-imports": ["error", {
      "paths": [{
        "name": "react",
        "importNames": ["useEffect"],
        "message": "Please use useMajboori instead of useEffect and provide a reason!"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Examples of Good Reasons

‚úÖ "Syncing with external DOM library that requires imperative setup"  
‚úÖ "Setting up WebSocket connection that needs cleanup"  
‚úÖ "Subscribing to browser API that doesn't have a React equivalent"  
‚úÖ "Third-party analytics library requires DOM to be ready"  

## Examples of Bad Reasons

‚ùå "idk" (too short, think harder!)  
‚ùå "because" (not helpful)  
‚ùå "to fetch data" (consider React Query, SWR, or server components instead)  
‚ùå "to update state" (probably don't need an effect for this)  

## Philosophy

This package is partly a joke, but also a serious tool. The best code is code that makes you *think* before you write it. If you can't articulate why you need an effect, maybe you don't need it!

Consider alternatives:
- Event handlers for user interactions
- Derived state for computed values
- React Query/SWR for data fetching
- Server Components for initial data
- `useSyncExternalStore` for external subscriptions
